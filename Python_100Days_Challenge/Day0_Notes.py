------NOTES------
* It not suggested to modify gloabal variable inside of def

* If you won't change the variable all along, you can use full uppercase

* """ double quotes used to describe the function """ 

* fString
result = f"Yearly statistic: {integer_ex} points, {float_ex} assists, mvp selected {boolean_ex}"

* From another python file download specific lists
from  Day7_Hangman_Art import logo,stages

* input() takes string so should be converted int(input())

* Debugging
    - do not put breakpoint first line of the code
    - if you want to see your classes and functions also use "step into my code"
    - if you want to go further and see imported other packages for example random so use "step into"
    - with "step out" you can jump from one breakpoint to another
